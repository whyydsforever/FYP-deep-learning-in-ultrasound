# FYP-deep-learning-in-ultrasound
This project is for the FYP of NUS Suzhou Research Institute. My project is Deep learning in Medical Ultrasound Images.<br>
The dataset is BUSI dataset, which is avalibale at https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=afahmy/pages/dataset <br>
Our project also used the Pix2PixHD model and made some adjustments. The offical Pix2PixHD model is at https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD. And the adjustments are in the Pix2PixHD folder. <br>
